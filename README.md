# New in SDK 3.13.0
- Fully tested for iOS 10
- Internal urls are now HTTPS, in preparation to be ATS compliant.
- Bug fixes

# OS Support and iOS 10
- iOS 7 is the minimum OS version supported iOS release
- In iOS 9 and 10, App Transport Security (ATS) is the default setting, which requires apps to make
network calls only over SSL. We are working with our partners to facilitate the transition to support this change to ensure compliance. In the meantime, if you want to release apps that support iOS 9/10, you will need to disable ATS in order to ensure everything continues to work as expected. To do so, just add the following to the plist of your apps:
```
        <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key> 
        <dict>
          <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
          <true/>
        </dict>
```
- Add `Bundle display name` to the plist of your apps for iOS 9. For instance
```
	<key>CFBundleDisplayName</key>
	<string>Bundle Display Name</string>
```
- Add 'NSPhotoLibraryUsageDescription' to your plist to allow users to save images from ads.

# Orientation
Tremor SDK requires applications to support all orientations, both portrait and landscape. If your application does not support landscape mode, you should ensure the UI in your application is portrait only. Here is an example (for iOS 6 and later):
- In your applicationâ€™s `UIViewController(s)`
- Implement the method `- (NSUInteger)supportedInterfaceOrientations`
- Set return value `UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortrait` or `UIInterfaceOrientationMaskPortraitUpsideDown`
