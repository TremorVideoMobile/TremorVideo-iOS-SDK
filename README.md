# OS Support and iOS 9
- iOS 6 is the minimum OS version supported iOS release
- App Transport Security (ATS) is the default setting in iOS 9, which requires apps to make
network calls only over SSL. We are working with our partners to facilitate the transition to support this change to ensure compliance. In the meantime, if you want to release apps that support iOS9, you will need to disable ATS in order to ensure everything continues to work as expected. To do so, just add the following to the plist of your apps:
```
        <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key> 
        <dict>
          <key>NSAllowsArbitraryLoads</key>
          <true/>
        </dict>
```
